Abstract - This project focuses on enhancing object tracking in dynamic scenes using the Kanade–
Lucas–Tomasi (KLT) feature tracker. KLT tracking is a widely used method for tracking objects by
detecting and tracking feature points in video sequences. The project aims to adapt and optimize KLT for
multiple objects in complex scenes, addressing challenges like occlusions, varying speeds, and background
clutter. The core of the project involves implementing the KLT algorithm, enhancing it to track multiple
objects simultaneously, and evaluating its performance in various real-world scenarios, including handling
object occlusions and maintaining robustness across different lighting conditions.
